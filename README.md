# Coangular is CompoundJS coupled with AngularJS

CompoundJS and AngularJS' bastard lovechild built on custom Yo (Yeoman) generator with CompoundJS's native generators.

structure (component files & directories) using our ejs chrome 
and view partials having angular required and custom 
controllers ready for binding.
