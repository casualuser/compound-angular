compound-angular
================

CompoundJS and AngularJS' bastard lovechild built 
upon a custom Yo (Yeoman) generator combined with 
CompoundJS's own native generators.

The goal of this super project is to integrate Angular code 
with Compound components using simply a common generator 
wrapper (this project's code) we'll name 'CompAng' for
Yo using 'yo init CompoundAngular' 

Our wrapper will start by executing a 'compound-init' bash
script which installs the Compound app and handles all 
its requirements.

Next it will step through 'yo-init' another bash script 
which will initialize the app structure (component files & 
directories) using our ejs chrome and view partials having 
angular required and custom controllers ready for binding.


Stay tuned.
