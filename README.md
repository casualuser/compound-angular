compound-angular
================

CompoundJS and AngularJS' bastard lovechild built 
upon a custom Yo (Yeoman) generator combined with 
CompoundJS's own native generators.

A more appropriate name for this little passion experiment might
be Compyeo or Yocompound, for now its boringly descriptive. 

The goal of this project is to show Angular code 
interacting with Compound components using simply 
a common generator wrapper (this project's code) we'll
name generate with Yo using the format 'yo init CompAng'

It will start with executing a 'compound-init' bash
script which installs the Compound app and requirements.

Next it will step through 'yo-init' another bash 
script which will initialize the files and directories
using ejs chrome and view partials having angular required
and custom controllers. 


Stay tuned.
