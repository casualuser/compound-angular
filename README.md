compound-angular
================

CompoundJS and AngularJS' bastard lovechild built 

upon a custom Yo (Yeoman) generator combined with 
CompoundJS's own native generators.



A more appropriate name for this little passion experiment might

be Compyeo or Yocompound, for now its boringly descriptive. 



The goal of this project is to show Angular code 

interacting with Compound components using simply 

a common generator wrapper (this project's code) we'll

name generate with Yo using the format 'yo init CompAng'



It will start with executing a 'compound-init' bash

script which installs the Compound app and requirements.



Next it will step through 'yo-init' another bash 

script which will initialize the files and directories

using ejs chrome and view partials having angular required

and custom controllers. 


Stay tuned.
