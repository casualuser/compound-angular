# Coangular is CompoundJS coupled with AngularJS

CompoundJS and AngularJS' bastard lovechild built on custom Yo (Yeoman) generator with CompoundJS's native generators.

script which installs the Compound app and handles requirements.

3. Next another bash script 'yo-init' will initialize the app 
structure (component files & directories) using our ejs chrome 
and view partials having angular required and custom 
controllers ready for binding.
